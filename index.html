    <p> Hi everyone! My name is Eileen Tieu. This is my APCV310 class. For this assignment, I was asked to be creative while getting comfortable with both HTML and CSS. I think that learning HTML after learning Python has made the learning process a lot easier to understand. I am currently using Visual Studio Code as my IDE. As I do this assignment I have learned many new commands. I'ce learned how to use an external CSS to keep my plain HTML page clean and organized. I have learned how to apply background colors, change the text style, the size of the text to make things such as headings stand out more. Working on the project has helped me see how design and structure come together to build a webopage. I've experimented with different colors and font styles to make my headings stand out even more. I also tried to use padding and margins to adjust the spacings. As I continue working on this, I plan to organize my code better. Eventually, I would love to learn how to build a full website to showcase my projects such as a personal portfolio where I can display everything I have worked on in a neat and clean space. I think this is a great way to keep track of my works and access it easily. Most importantlant sho others what I have learned so far.
