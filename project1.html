        This is the link to the project I did last semester for my APCV 361 Data analysis and visualization class. I analyzed public health disparities between WA and TX using python, Matplotlib, pandas and numpy for data processing and cleaning. I used matplotlib to compare child poverty and flu vaccination between states. I have also implemented statistical models such as linear regression and machine learning algotrithms such as random forest to identify signitifcation predictors fo healthcare disparities and optimize data-driver insights. For this project I used Jupyter Notebook as my IDE with Anaconda as an extention for the IDE. After that I uploaded my results, which includes additional descriptions, into github.
